# API Migration Plan

This document outlines the plan to migrate the existing console application to a Flask API.

## 1. Gather Information

*   Read the contents of `app.py` and `db.py` to understand the current business logic and database interactions.
*   Examine `requirements.txt` to identify existing dependencies and determine if Flask needs to be added.

## 2. Clarify Requirements

*   Confirm the expected data types for the 'content' and 'collection-name' fields in the JSON payload (both strings).
*   Define error handling requirements: HTTP 200 for success, 500 for database errors, and 400 for invalid input.

## 3. Design the API

*   Define the Flask route `/is-exist-in-db` to handle POST requests.
*   Implement the API endpoint to:
    *   Parse the JSON payload from the request.
    *   Extract the 'content', 'field', and 'collection-name' values.
    *   Call the existing business logic from `db.py` to check for existence in the database.
    *   Return a JSON response with the same data structure as the current console application.

## 4. Implement the API

*   Modify `app.py` to include the Flask framework and the API endpoint.
*   Ensure that the existing business logic is correctly integrated into the API endpoint.
*   Add error handling to return appropriate HTTP status codes and JSON responses for different error conditions.

## 5. Update Dependencies

*   Add Flask to `requirements.txt` if it's not already present.

## 6. Testing

*   Write a simple test script or use a tool like `curl` or Postman to send POST requests to the API endpoint and verify the responses.

## 7. Documentation

*   Update the `README.md` file to include instructions on how to run the Flask API.
